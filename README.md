FRIENDS ARE FRIENDS DESPITE THEIR BYTERATE!!

This script detect if a connection have a lower byterate.

Mhhh… I think is not true, 
This script detect if the connetion have not a lower byterate and then permit to do something.

The concept is… if the connection have not problem then load alots 
of great think and make a great experience for user :)

This is released in AGPL with the hope that alots of people want to make it better, faster etc etc…

There is a lot to do… this is just a fast concept in code, a pre-alpha version! 
Do not use in production!


Thanks
